# Movie Recommendation System
Our project is a Movie Recommendation System that will recommend users movies to watch based on their friend's interest
by ranking the favorite genres of all movies the user has provided and comparing it with their freinds to display movies
that they all could be potentially interested in

# How to run the program in the command line
The program will be run from the command line by the user first being prompt to enter the user's name. Then it will ask the user to enter their favorite movies, given that it is in our database of movies and will be ask to continue adding movies or stop whenever when they want too. Finally, the user can add more users if they want too which will repeat the whole process again and are given the option to stop when neccessary.
